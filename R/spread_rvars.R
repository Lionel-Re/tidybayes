# spread_rvars ------------------------------------------------------------

#' Extract random variables from a Bayesian model into a tidy data format
#'
#' Extract draws from a Bayesian model for one or more variables (possibly with named
#' dimensions) into one of two types of long-format data frames containing [posterior::rvar] objects.
#'
#' @param model A supported Bayesian model fit. Tidybayes supports a variety of model objects;
#' for a full list of supported models, see [tidybayes-models].
#' @param ... Expressions in the form of
#' `variable_name[dimension_1, dimension_2, ...]`. See *Details*.
#' @param n The number of draws to return, or `NULL` to return all draws.
#' @param seed A seed to use when subsampling draws (i.e. when `n` is not `NULL`).
#' @return A data frame.
