## Resubmission
This is a resubmission to fix a URL redirect to point to its new URL.

## Submission comments
This submission is primarily to update the maintainer email address from
mjskay@umich.edu to mjskay@northwestern.edu as I have moved institutions.
Unfortunately this can't be verified by emailing mjskay@umich.edu because
my umich email address has already been deactivated. However, the change is
reflected on both my Github page (https://github.com/mjskay) and my personal 
website (http://mjskay.com) and I am happy to provide other proof if needed.
